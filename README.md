# Tree Implementation with Laravel

This project demonstrates how to implement and manage a hierarchical tree structure in a Laravel 12 application. It provides CRUD functionality for tree nodes, including adding, editing, deleting, and displaying hierarchical data using Laravel's Eloquent ORM and migrations.

## Features

- **Laravel 12** as the backend framework.
- **Eloquent ORM** for managing tree structures in the database.
- **Migrations** for creating tables and managing the tree structure in the database.
- Simple implementation of **CRUD operations** to create, read, update, and delete tree nodes.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- PHP 8.1+ with Composer
- Laravel 12.x
- A database (MySQL, SQLite, etc.)
  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tree-implementation-laravel.git
   cd tree-implementation-laravel
   ```

2. Install the PHP dependencies:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Set up your `.env` file by copying the example:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

4. Configure your database connection in the `.env` file.

5. Run migrations to set up the database schema:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. Seed the database with sample tree data (if you have a seeder setup):

   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

7. Start the Laravel development server:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

   You can access the application at `http://localhost:8000`.

## CRUD Operations for Tree Nodes

The application uses Laravelâ€™s Eloquent ORM to manage tree nodes stored in the database. Here's an overview of the basic operations:

- **Create a Node**: Adds a new node to the tree.
- **Read a Node**: Retrieves information about a specific node.
- **Update a Node**: Modifies an existing node.
- **Delete a Node**: Removes a node from the tree.

### Example of Node Model

```php
class Node extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['parent_id', 'name'];

    // Define the relationship between parent and child nodes
    public function parent()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Node::class, 'parent_id');
    }

    public function children()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Node::class, 'parent_id');
    }
}
```

In this example, each node has a `parent_id` and `name` that define its position in the tree.

## Development

If you want to contribute or modify the application, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tree-implementation-laravel.git
   ```

2. Create a new branch for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```

3. Install the PHP dependencies:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. Run migrations and seed the database:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

5. After making changes, run the development server:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

6. Commit and push your changes:

   ```bash
   git commit -am "Add new feature"
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   ```

7. Create a pull request to merge your feature.
