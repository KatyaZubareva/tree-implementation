# Tree Structure Implementation

This project implements a tree structure to store and display hierarchical data. The tree structure can be used in various applications, such as a file system, table of contents for a book, or XML structure representation.

## Features

- Store hierarchical data in a database (using Laravel or raw PHP with PDO).
- Retrieve data as a tree structure (nested).
- Retrieve data as a flat list (non-hierarchical).
- Methods for adding, deleting, and fetching tree elements.

### Methods:

1. **Add Node**: Allows adding a new node to the tree.
2. **Delete Node**: Deletes a node from the tree.
3. **Get Tree**: Fetches the entire tree structure with nested children.
4. **Get Flat List**: Fetches all tree elements in a flat structure.

## Installation

### Requirements

- PHP >= 7.3
- Composer
- Laravel (for the Laravel version) or raw PHP with PDO
- A database (MySQL, SQLite, etc.)

### Setup for Laravel

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tree-structure

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Set up the environment:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
   - Configure your database connection in the `.env` file.

4. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

5. Start the Laravel development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

6. Visit `http://localhost:8000` to view the tree structure.

### Setup for Raw PHP (without Laravel)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tree-structure
   ```

2. Set up the database configuration (update `config.php` or similar file).

3. Run the project by opening the `index.php` file in a web server (like XAMPP, WAMP, etc.).

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can use the application to:

- **View the tree structure**.
- **Add new nodes** to the tree.
- **Delete nodes**.
- **View the flat list** of all tree nodes.
